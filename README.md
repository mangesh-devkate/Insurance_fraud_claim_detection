Project Title : Insurance Fraud Claim Detection

Technologies : Machine Learning Technology

Domain : Insurance

Problem Statement: 
Claim related fraud is a huge problem in the insurance industry. It is quite complex and difficult to identify those unwanted claims. With Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm, I am trying to troubleshoot and help the General Insurance industry with this problem.
The data that I have is from Automobile Insurance industry. I will be creating a predictive model that predicts if an insurance claim is fraudulent or not. The answer between YES/NO, is a Binary Classification task. A comparison study has been performed to understand which ML algorithm suits best to the dataset.

Approach: 
The classical machine learning tasks like Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Handling Imabalanced Dataset, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.
Some Famous Algorithms:  Logistic Regression, Decision tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Adaboost Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier


Results: 
You have to build a solution that should able to predict if an insurance claim is fraudulent or not.
